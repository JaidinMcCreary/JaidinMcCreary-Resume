        <div class="subheading mb-5">General Artist Management</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">This wonderful, jam-packed job is truly what keeps me on my toes. My career consists of the management and the promotion of various musical artists. This can be musical groups, solo artists, duo’s, trios, and other performers. I schedule events, variety shows, concerts, and more pertaining to the artist. I even do my part in preparing for comebacks by submitting ideas, designs, and any other content that might further the artists success. iMy job is pretty flexible and interim, which allows me to meet many artists and connect with different people. After each managing session (anywhere between 2 weeks and a year) I make more connections and meet more people that might benefit the next artist. I have personally worked with many Korean Pop Artists and groups–which are my favorite to work with. Just to name a few, I have worked with BtoB, BtoB Blue, BTS, TXT, April, Aprink, AoA, Stray Kids, Treasure, Oneus, Onlyoneof, EXO, GOT7, ENHYPEN, Ateez, and so much more. I am extremely grateful to have had all of those great and wonderful opportunities and now new friends.  And although it sounds like a glamorous career field—it also takes a lot of hard work. The most strenuous part of this job is definitely the large amounts of paperwork and having to constantly travel. Most days, I am completely swamped with paperwork and documents to fill out. I work with many artists so it is important that I know almost everything about them. This job calls for a lot of studying, time management, and scheduling. As I said previously, I work with various artists at different intervals. So I may work with BTS in South Korea for two months and then get stationed to work in the United States with Lizzo. There are a lot of times where I really don’t want to leave my family, but work calls for it. Other times, I am extremely excited to travel and do what I love! I honestly do not know what to write about so here is some background. I am currently an undeclared student at UCR and I really enjoy this school. I don't think I would choose anything different. I really love the area it's in and the people. I love how diverse it is and the plethora of classes, courses, and majors they have. Even though I am undeclared. It is truly a really great school and I love it here. I graduated high school in Spring of 2021. It was a bit sad because we couldn't have a graduation ceremony. Sike, I just didn't go because I sorta hated school then. But It felt really nice to pick up my diploma when I finished school. I happened to finish on my birthday just a month earlier than graduation. April 13. I was able to enjoy my spring and summer without worrying about school. And when fall came, I started school here at UCR. And as I mentioned before, I love it here.<br><br>
